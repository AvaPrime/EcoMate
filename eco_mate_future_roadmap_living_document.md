# EcoMate – Future Roadmap (Living Document)

This roadmap consolidates the current upgrade plan and future objectives for EcoMate into a unified strategy. It aligns all four data domains—Market & Supply Chain, Regulatory & Compliance, Environmental & Geographic, and Operational & Predictive—so that development phases build on one another and the platform evolves coherently.

---

## Phase 1 – Foundation (0–3 months)
- **Proposal & Costing**: Vendor API integration for live pricing, stock, and branded PDF output.  
- **Catalog & Maintenance**: Normalizers for Shopify/WooCommerce/Medusa; Scheduler with site/environmental rules.  
- **Compliance**: Base YAML rulesets (SANS, ISO) with CI compliance gate.  
- **Environmental Context**: Geocoding, distance, elevation, slope, soil class, rainfall normals; Terrain & climate multipliers in cost model; Protected-area pilot checks.  
- **Telemetry**: Rolling baseline ingestor, TimescaleDB/InfluxDB + Grafana dashboards.  

---

## Phase 2 – Expansion (3–6 months)
- **Market Intelligence**: Competitor monitoring; Alternative sourcing workflows (Alibaba/local distributors).  
- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Connectors for SANS, ISO, EPA; Feed monitor with draft rule files.  
- **Environmental Context**: Daily climate series + drought index; Contextualized telemetry alerts.  
- **Operational Intelligence**: IoT ingestion pipeline; Merge telemetry with maintenance logs; Early predictive models.  

---

## Phase 3 – Advanced Intelligence (6–12 months)
- **Proposal Agent**: Scenario modeling and ROI (NPV/IRR).  
- **Compliance by Construction**: Auto-suggest compliant designs; Municipal bylaw rulesets.  
- **Telemetry & Predictive Maintenance**: Automated pre-emptive work orders; Efficiency optimization.  
- **Digital Twin**: Interactive schematic overlays; Compliance + BOM + telemetry in one view; “What-if” simulations.  

---

## Future State (12+ months)
- **Data & Regulatory**: Autonomous supplier selection; Automated rule ingestion; Predictive alerts; Hydrology and soil/water overlays.  
- **Technological Advances**: Full digital twin simulation environment; AR/VR visualization; Multi-agent orchestration.  
- **Platform Autonomy**: End-to-end workflows (proposal → compliance → maintenance → optimization); LLM-backed advisory agents.  
- **Market Expansion**: Extensions to solar, HVAC, smart-grid; White-label platform options.  
- **Advanced Simulation & AI**: Reinforcement learning with digital twin for trade-off optimization.  

---

## Living Roadmap Practice
- **Cadence:** Update every sprint (2–3 weeks).  
- **Inputs:** Supplier APIs, regulatory feeds, IoT logs, climate services.  
- **Outputs:** Refined priorities, GitHub issues/epics, updated docs.  

---

## Strategic Trajectory
- **Phase 1**: Foundation with live data + compliance basics.  
- **Phase 2**: Intelligence through competitor monitoring, regulatory feeds, IoT ingestion.  
- **Phase 3**: Predictive maintenance + Digital Twin.  
- **Future State**: Fully autonomous, simulation-driven EcoMate ecosystem with self-tuning systems, AR/VR diagnostics, and multi-agent orchestration.
