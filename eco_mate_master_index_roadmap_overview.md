# Usage
1. **Start here** with the Master Index to choose the relevant domain or plan.
2. **Follow links** into each detailed artifact for technical implementation.
3. **Keep synchronized**: when one file is updated, ensure references in the Master Index remain current.

This index ensures a clear and unambiguous roadmap for EcoMate’s ongoing development.
