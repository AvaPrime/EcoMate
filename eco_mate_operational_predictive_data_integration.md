# EcoMate – Operational & Predictive Data Integration

This plan defines how EcoMate connects real-world system telemetry with predictive intelligence, transforming the platform into an autonomous, self-optimizing partner.

---

## 1. Real-Time IoT & Sensor Data
**Purpose:** Enable live performance monitoring and alerts.
- **Implementation:** Deploy IoT devices to stream flow rate, water temperature, energy, UV intensity, pump pressure.
- **Ingestion:** Secure endpoints (`telemetry/router_ingest.py`) storing data in TimescaleDB/InfluxDB.
- **Dashboard:** Grafana or custom UI for real-time visibility.

**Value:** Transparent monitoring; instant critical alerts.

---

## 2. Historical & Maintenance Data
**Purpose:** Correlate work orders and telemetry to move from reactive to proactive.
- **Implementation:** `maintenance/history.py` joins work orders with telemetry.
- **ML Workflow:** Train models to predict MTBF and detect degradation patterns.
- **Output:** Predictive insights stored in `telemetry/predictions/`.

**Value:** Predictive maintenance scheduling; optimized performance tuning.

---

## 3. The Digital Twin
**Purpose:** Create a virtual real-time representation of each system.
- **Components:** Location, BOM, compliance, telemetry, predictive data.
- **Implementation:** `digital_twin/api.py` exposes system state + simulation endpoints.
- **UI:** Interactive schematic/3D model with overlays and what-if simulation.

**Value:** Shared, simulation-driven view of system health and compliance.

## 4. Integration Pattern
**File Layout:**
```
services/
  telemetry/
    router_ingest.py
    store.py
    predictor.py
  maintenance/
    history.py
  digital_twin/
    api.py
```

**Workflow Hooks:**
- Telemetry events → store + baseline → predictor scoring.
- Predictor → MaintenanceWorkflow opens PRs for preventative replacement.
- Digital Twin API aggregates all data sources.

**Security:** TLS and token auth; device buffering via MQTT/Redis.

---

## 5. Phasing
- **Phase 1:** Telemetry ingestion + dashboards.
- **Phase 2:** Join with maintenance history; train predictive models.
- **Phase 3:** Digital Twin API + interactive UI.
- **Phase 4:** Full autonomy with optimization and orchestration.

---

By integrating IoT, predictive analytics, and digital twin modeling, EcoMate becomes a **self-optimizing ecosystem** that anticipates issues, prevents downtime, and continuously improves efficiency.
