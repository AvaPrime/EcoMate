Actions:

Add /health route (matches Dockerfile healthcheck).

Validate .env.example defaults, fail gracefully if external API keys missing.

Harden prod: run behind Uvicorn/Gunicorn with multiple workers, HTTPS, debug off.

Add basic rate-limiting & input validation.

Upload social preview banner.

Enable branch protection on main.

Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant).

Complete GitHub community checklist.

5. CI/CD & Release Workflow

CI: Ensure tests, linting, typing, security scans run on all PRs. Add CodeQL.

CD: Verify container image name/tags (ghcr.io/AvaPrime/EcoMate/api:0.1.0).

Release: Dry-run workflow to check changelog, artifact upload.

Deployment checklist:

Secure DB creds.

MinIO bucket + creds.

Temporal persistence/backups.

Optionally add docker-compose.prod.yml with hardened defaults.

Document required env vars in README or docs.

6. Security & Community

SECURITY.md: update versions table ‚Üí 0.1.0.

Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

CONTRIBUTING.md: clarify contribution licensing (proprietary).

Governance: add statement about EcoMate team maintaining direction.

Run dependency + vulnerability scan (Safety, Dependabot, CodeQL).

Consider adding LEGAL/THIRD_PARTY.md.

7. Observability & Ops

Logging: Structured JSON logs for API & worker.

Metrics: Prometheus scrapers for FastAPI, Temporal, MinIO. Ship Grafana dashboards.

Tracing: Add OpenTelemetry hooks (optional for v0.1.0).

Alerts: API heartbeat, workflow failures, MinIO storage thresholds.

Backups: Postgres dumps/restore tests, MinIO replication/backups.

Hardening: Non-root containers (already set), image scans, TLS on public endpoints.

‚úÖ Release Checklist (Final Mile)

Docs live at correct URL, links fixed.

Repo metadata polished (desc, tags, preview).

Branch protection enabled.

CI passing on all PRs; CodeQL enabled.

Release workflow dry-run successful.

SECURITY.md + CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md updated.

Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana basic dashboard ready.
