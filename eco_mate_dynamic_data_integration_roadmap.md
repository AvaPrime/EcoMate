# EcoMate – Dynamic Data Integration Roadmap

To evolve EcoMate into an **industry‑leading, dynamic information resource**, the platform must integrate real‑time, external data sources. This ensures that proposals, compliance checks, and telemetry insights are always current and competitive.

---

## 1. Market & Supply Chain Data
**Objective:** Ensure proposals reflect live market conditions and avoid quoting unavailable parts.
- **Vendor APIs**: Replace static `parts_list.csv` with integrations to supplier APIs. Pull live pricing, stock levels, product specs.
- **Wholesale Marketplaces**: Integrate Alibaba or local distributor APIs. Auto-source cheapest qualified component for each BOM line. Add supplier selection logic to Proposal Agent.

---

## 2. Regulatory & Compliance Databases
**Objective:** Keep Compliance Agent aligned with the latest standards.
- **Standards Body APIs**: Connect to SANS, ISO, or local government databases. Auto-update YAML rule files on schedule with version control.
- **Legal & Environmental Feeds**: Subscribe to legislative feeds (e.g., water regulations, energy codes). Trigger Compliance Agent updates when new rules are published.

---

## 3. Environmental & Geographic Data
**Objective:** Add context to proposals and improve accuracy of cost/performance estimates.
- **Geospatial APIs**: Use Google Maps API for logistics distance & site access. Integrate terrain and soil data for construction feasibility.
- **Climate & Weather APIs**: Pull historical rainfall, sunlight, and temperature data. Factor into proposal ROI and system sizing.

---

## 4. Operational & Predictive Data
**Objective:** Make maintenance and telemetry predictive, not reactive.
- **Machine Data Feeds**: Stream sensor/IoT data into Telemetry Agent. Build per-site dashboards (flow, energy use, water quality).
- **Maintenance History DB**: Ingest work orders into a historical dataset. Train predictive models for MTBF (mean time between failures). Scheduler issues tasks before failure is likely.

---

## 5. Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1 (0–3 months)**: Vendor API connectors (2–3 suppliers), Google Maps API for logistics cost, rule ingestion for SANS/ISO updates.
- **Phase 2 (3–6 months)**: Wholesale marketplace integration, rainfall/solar climate data, IoT telemetry ingestion pipelines.
- **Phase 3 (6–12 months)**: Predictive MTBF models, real-time dashboards, automated compliance feed parsing.
- **Phase 4 (12+ months)**: Digital twin simulations combining climate, soil, IoT, and cost models; fully autonomous proposal generation.

---

## 6. Benefits
- **Accuracy**: Quotes reflect current supplier prices & stock.
- **Compliance**: Rules always up-to-date.
- **Context**: Designs tuned for local conditions.
- **Proactivity**: Maintenance preventative, not reactive.
- **Trust**: EcoMate becomes an authoritative, real-time knowledge source.

This roadmap feeds into the **Living Roadmap Document** and should be updated as APIs, feeds, and partnerships evolve.
