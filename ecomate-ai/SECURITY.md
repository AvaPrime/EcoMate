## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in EcoMate AI, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead, please:**

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@ecomate.co.za`
2. **Subject Line**: Include "[SECURITY]" prefix
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Critical issues within 30 days, others within 90 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### Vulnerability Assessment Criteria

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection with data access
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to admin

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Local file inclusion
- Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of service attacks

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Weak cryptographic practices

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable misconfigurations

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Use secure random number generation
- Keep dependencies updated

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement strong password policies
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure token generation and validation

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

1. **P0 - Critical**: Active exploitation, data breach
2. **P1 - High**: Potential for exploitation, sensitive data at risk
3. **P2 - Medium**: Security weakness, limited impact
4. **P3 - Low**: Minor security concern, informational

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to limit damage
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
