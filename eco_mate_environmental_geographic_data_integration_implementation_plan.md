# EcoMate – Environmental & Geographic Data Integration (Implementation Plan)

This plan incorporates site-specific environmental and geographic context into proposals and telemetry, ensuring designs and alerts are accurate and relevant.

---

## 1. Geospatial & Topographical APIs
**Purpose:** Enhance proposals with logistics, terrain, and soil context.
- **Implementation:** Integrate Google Maps (geocoding, distance, elevation), SoilGrids, and DEM-based slope calculations.
- **Usage:** Cost multipliers in `cost_model.py` for slope/soil difficulty; logistics cost per km.
- **Output:** Proposals automatically reflect installation complexity.

---

## 2. Climate & Hydrological Data
**Purpose:** Factor local weather into ROI and sizing.
- **Implementation:** Integrate Open-Meteo, NASA POWER for rainfall & temperature normals.
- **Usage:** Enrich `SystemSpec` with rainfall & temperature; optimize tank sizing and ROI.
- **Telemetry:** Contextualize alerts (e.g., mute low-flow alarms during drought).

---

## 3. Public & Environmental Databases
**Purpose:** Prevent illegal or non-viable designs.
- **Implementation:** Query protected areas and permits APIs.
- **Usage:** Proposal workflow flags restricted zones; adds permit requirements to checklist.

## 4. Integration Pattern
**File Layout:**
```
services/geo/
  geocode.py
  distance.py
  elevation.py
  slope.py
  soil.py
services/climate/
  open_meteo.py
  nasa_power.py
  drought.py
services/environment/
  protected_areas.py
  permits.py
```

**Workflow Hooks:**
- Proposal workflow → enrich site & climate.
- Cost model → apply multipliers.
- Telemetry workflow → contextualize alerts.

---

## 5. Next Steps
- Build `enrich_site` activity for proposals.
- Implement protected-area check for pilot region.
- Integrate rainfall normals into rainwater harvesting proposals.
- Add slope & soil multipliers to cost model.

---

By integrating geospatial, climate, and environmental data, EcoMate proposals and telemetry become **location-aware, compliant, and resilient**.
