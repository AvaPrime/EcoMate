# EcoMate – Regulatory & Compliance Data Integration

This document defines how EcoMate integrates regulatory and compliance data to ensure all proposals and systems remain legally robust and up to date.

---

## 1. Governmental & Standards Body APIs
**Purpose:** Connect directly to official rulesets.
- **Implementation:** Extend `services/compliance/engine.py` to poll APIs from SANS, ISO, EPA, etc.
- **Storage:** Auto-commit updates into `compliance/rules/` with version control.
- **Validation:** CI pipeline tests new rules for validity.

**Value:** Compliance Agent always aligned with the latest standards.

---

## 2. Legal & Environmental Feeds
**Purpose:** Anticipate upcoming regulations.
- **Implementation:** New activity `activity_regulatory_monitor` to ingest RSS/Atom feeds.
- **Processing:** Use LLM summarization to highlight changes and impacts.
- **Outputs:** Draft *pending* rule files created in PRs.

**Value:** Early warnings and future-proofing of proposals.

---

## 3. Public Record Databases
**Purpose:** Add due diligence to proposals.
- **Implementation:** Create `services/compliance/public_records.py` with per-region adapters.
- **Use Case:** Proposal Agent checks permits, zoning, and water rights eligibility during intake.
- **Cache:** Store queries keyed by site identifier.

**Value:** Reduced risk of cancellations or legal disputes.

## 4. Integration Pattern
**File Layout:**
```
services/compliance/
  engine.py
  sources/
    sans.py
    iso.py
    epa.py
  feeds/monitor.py
  public_records.py
```

**Workflow Hooks:**
- Proposal workflow → public records check.
- Compliance workflow → validate spec against latest standards.
- Regulatory monitor → summarize feeds, create draft rules.

**Automation:**
- GitHub Action cron pulls & commits new rules weekly.
- Compliance gate in CI blocks merges on non-compliance.

---

## 5. Next Steps
- Build first connector (e.g., SANS water rules).
- Implement regulatory monitor for 1–2 legal feeds.
- Wire eligibility check into Proposal Agent for a pilot region.

---

By integrating these data sources, EcoMate’s Compliance Agent evolves into a **living regulatory intelligence system** that continuously adapts and safeguards client projects.
